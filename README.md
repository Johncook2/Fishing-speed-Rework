# Fishing Speed Rework
A Semi-finished Dredge mod about reworking fishing speed 

## Idea
Instead of having fishing speed increase the rate at which the fish on the left tracker moves up, it will instead increase the speed at which the indicator/targets move on the UI. This will make it possible to fish faster with a higher fishing speed, but also make it harder.

## Content
+ Changes the effect of fishing speed on every fishing minigame

## Planned Content
+ Maybe reworking dredging too
+ (Bonus) Having the fishing talisman revert all changes, so it will not make it impossible to fish
