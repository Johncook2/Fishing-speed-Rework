# Fishing Speed Rework
A work in progress Dredge mod about reworking fishing speed 

## Idea
Instead of having fishing speed increase the rate at which the fish on the left tracker moves up, it will instead increase the speed at which the indicator/targets move on the UI. This will make it so that in the same sense you can theoretically fish faster with 10 fishing poles rather than 1, you can now theoretically catch fish faster by simultaneously using a heavy-duty winch, an onboard harvesting platform and a sinew spindle if you are skilled enough.

## Content
+ Reworks the base fishing minigame

## Planned Content
+ Reworking every other fishing minigame
+ Maybe reworking dredging too
+ (Bonus) Having the fishing talisman revert all changes, so fishing speed is acually helpfull

## Time to complete
Like, maybe a month or something less. I'm not really sure.
