# Fishing Speed Rework
A mostly finished Dredge mod about reworking fishing speed. Currently in beta testing to see if how the current values are. Feel free to test the mod as well as commenting on how it could be improved.

## Content
+ Causes fishing speeds to effect the movement speed in fishing minigames
+ Halved the speed in which you automatically catch fish

## Planned Content
+ Maybe reworking dredging too
+ (Bonus) Having the fishing talisman revert all changes, so high fishing speed modifiers become a straight upgrade again.
