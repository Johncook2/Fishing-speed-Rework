# Fishing Speed Rework
A work in progress Dredge mod about reworking fishing speed 

## Idea
Has it ever bugged you that fishing speed scales off of the amount of fishing tools on the ship, yet only makes it easier to fish? Well, it has bugged me and here is my solution. Instead of having fishing speed increase the rate at which the fish on the left tracker moves up, it will instead increase the speed at which things move. In the same sense that you can theoretically fish faster with 10 fishing poles rather than 1, you can now theoretically catch fish faster if you are skilled enough.

## Content
+ Reworks the base fishing minigame

## Planned Content
+ Reworking every other fishing minigame
+ Maybe reworking dredge too
+ (Bonus) Having the fishing talisman revert all changes, so fishing speed is acually helpfull

## Time to complete
Like, maybe a month or something less. I'm not really sure.
